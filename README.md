## Introduction
This repository serves two purposes simultaneously; to turn in Cloud Native Computing course material and to develop a base and practice for showcasing my passion for zanjabeel in a website.
### What is Zanjabeel?
Zanjabeel is the Arabic term used for Ginger. Also the term Zanjabeel is used in the Quran as one of the flavors of the drinks given in Jannah. Ginger has many properties that makes it so popular in Arab and Asian cultures. It is widely used in spices, drinks and folk medicine. While visiting Makkah al Mukarramah in February 2020 for Umra, one day I was waiting for Maghrib adhan sitting in a row inside the Haram. It was Thursday and to keep fast on Thursdays is a Sunnah of Alrasool, SAA, a tradition many Arabs and Muslims in general follow with great respect. It's customary to bring home-made drinks along with dates from Madinah, milk, bread and cheese to the Masjid to break their fast. In a matchless gesture of hospitality, a local Arab resident offered me a small cup of a yellow-lemonish colored drink I had never seen or tasted before.
